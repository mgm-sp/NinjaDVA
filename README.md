# NinjaDVA -- NinjaDVA is not just another Damn Vulnerable Application

The goal of this project is an environment, which integrates several
vulnerable VMs. In order to run VM, first launch the gateway VM using
Vagrant. Afterwards you may launch the dashboard and other VMs (see
your_vulnerable_vm for an example)
